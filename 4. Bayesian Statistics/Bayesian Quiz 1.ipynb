    "In the NFL, a professional American football league, there are 32 teams, of which 12 make the playoffs. In a typical season, 20 teams (the ones that don’t make the playoffs) play 16 games, 4 teams play 17 games, 6 teams play 18 games, and 2 teams play 19 games. At the beginning of each game, a coin is flipped to determine who gets the football first. You are told that an unknown team won ten of its coin flips last season. Given this information, what is the posterior probability that the team did not make the playoffs (i.e. played 16 games)?\n",

    "You are testing dice for a casino to make sure that sixes do not come up more frequently than expected. Because you do not want to manually roll dice all day, you design a machine to roll a die repeatedly and record the number of sixes that come face up. In order to do a Bayesian analysis to test the hypothesis that p = 1/6 versus p = .175 , you set the machine to roll the die 6000 times. When you come back at the end of the day, you discover to your horror that the machine was unable to count higher than 999. The machine says that 999 sixes occurred. Given a prior probability of 0.8 placed on the hypothesis p = 1/6 , what is the posterior probability that the die is fair, given the censored data? \n",
